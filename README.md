# Ethernet Gateway

A telnet-based XMODEM/YMODEM/ZMODEM/Kermit/Punter file transfer server, SSH
gateway, Hayes-compatible modem emulator on **two physically
independent serial ports** (each with optional telnet-serial console
bridge) for serial-attached retro hardware, text-mode web browser, and
AI chat client written in Rust. Supports PETSCII (Commodore 64), ANSI,
and ASCII terminals. Designed for local network use with retro and
modern terminal clients. An optional **master/slave** mode extends a
gateway's serial ports to another gateway over SSH.

**[User Manual](http://ethernetgateway.com/index.html)**
&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;
**[Kermit Reference](http://ethernetgateway.com/kermit.html)**

Once you run the server on your PC, you can telnet to that server from
anywhere on your network (allow firewall port 2323).

Example: `telnet 192.168.1.160:2323`

This program also serves as a modem emulator. For an Altairduino PRO,
connect directly to the altairduino, and set your modem port to be 2SIO2.
(A6/A7 on mine). Remember, you can configure the serial ports by pressing
stop and aux1 up.

Run IMP8, then hit T for terminal mode on the Altairduino.

Example: `ATDT :2323` — for gateway options: `ATDT ethernet-gateway`

Note: For the Altairduino, I simply connected my USB to RS232 adapter to
the 9 pin RS232 connector.

For other machines, you may need to use a NULL modem adapter (Cross RX
and TX).

This should also work with the RC2014 / SC126, etc as well.

## Warning

**The telnet interface is intended for local/private network use only.** Telnet
transmits all data (including credentials) in cleartext. Do not expose the
telnet port to the public internet. The SSH interface provides encrypted access
but is still intended for trusted environments.

### Network Security Behavior

When **security is disabled** (the default), the server only accepts telnet
connections from private IP addresses:

- `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16` (RFC 1918 private ranges)
- `127.0.0.0/8` (loopback)
- `169.254.0.0/16` (link-local)
- IPv6 loopback (`::1`), link-local (`fe80::/10`), and unique local (`fd00::/8`)

Connections from public IP addresses are refused with an error message.
Additionally, gateway addresses (those ending in `.1`, such as `192.168.1.1`)
are rejected to prevent accidental exposure through router interfaces.

To accept connections from **any IP address**, you must enable security
(`security_enabled = true` in `egateway.conf`) and set a strong username and
password. Even with security enabled, running this software on a public network
is **not recommended** — telnet credentials are transmitted in cleartext and can
be intercepted. Use the SSH interface for any non-local access.

### Outbound Connections (Dial-Out)

The above guards apply to **inbound** connections. The gateway's **outbound**
features — the modem emulator's `ATDT` dial-out, the **Telnet Gateway** and
**SSH Gateway** menu options, and the master/slave relay's onward dial — connect
to whatever host and port you ask for, with **no internal-address filtering**.
This is by design: a modem (and a gateway) dials anywhere, including loopback
(`127.0.0.1`), link-local, and other hosts on the gateway's own LAN.

One implication for **master/slave** mode: a serial device on a *slave* can, via
the slave's modem dial-out, cause the *master* to open a connection on the
master's own network — including the master's loopback and LAN — and pipe the
bytes back to the device. The slave authenticates to the master with the
master's credentials, so treat a slave (and the devices attached to it) as
trusted to reach the master's network, exactly as you would a device attached
directly to the master. Only enable `master_accept_relays` for slaves you trust
at that level — and note that a slave's relay *onward-dial* additionally
requires the master's `allow_peer_dial` to be on, so the master refuses the
outbound connection when it is off.

The text-mode **web browser** is the one exception: it *does* refuse internal
addresses (an SSRF guard), because web fetches and HTTP redirects make that a
sharper risk. That guard is lifted by `disable_ip_safety`.

## Standards Compliance

### Telnet RFCs

The embedded telnet server and the client half of the Telnet Gateway implement
the core parts of the telnet protocol suite that matter for interactive
terminal and BBS use:

| RFC | Title | Implementation notes |
|-----|-------|----------------------|
| **RFC 854** | Telnet Protocol Specification | IAC framing, IAC IAC data escaping, two-byte command handling. AYT replies with `[Yes]`; IP / BRK surface as ESC to the line-editor; EC translates to DEL (backspace) and EL to NAK (erase-line) so line-input honors them; NOP / DM / AO / GA are consumed. Full TCP urgent-mode SYNCH is not implemented (DM is informational) — per RFC 6093 the urgent mechanism is deprecated because middleboxes routinely strip or mangle the urgent pointer. Outbound 0xFF bytes are escaped as IAC IAC; inbound IAC sequences are consumed transparently. |
| **RFC 855** | Telnet Option Specifications | DO / DONT / WILL / WONT negotiation with per-option state. Options we don't support receive WONT / DONT so the peer doesn't wait. |
| **RFC 857** | Telnet Echo Option | The server advertises WILL ECHO to become the echoing side and honors peer requests for ECHO. |
| **RFC 858** | Suppress Go Ahead Option | WILL SGA / DO SGA to operate in full-duplex character-at-a-time mode (rather than half-duplex GA mode). |
| **RFC 859** | Status Option | `DO STATUS` → `WILL STATUS`; `IAC SB STATUS SEND IAC SE` returns an `IAC SB STATUS IS <state> IAC SE` dump listing every option the server has advertised and not had denied. Usable via the Unix `telnet` client's `status` / `send status` subcommands. |
| **RFC 860** | Timing Mark Option | `DO TIMING-MARK` is answered with `WILL TIMING-MARK` after flushing pending output, providing clients a processing-synchronization point. The response is one-shot — no persistent option state. |
| **RFC 1073** | Window Size Option (NAWS) | Client-reported window dimensions are captured via `IAC SB NAWS <w16><h16> IAC SE` and exposed to the session for layout decisions. |
| **RFC 1091** | Terminal-Type Option (TTYPE) | On client WILL TTYPE the server replies DO, then issues `IAC SB TTYPE SEND IAC SE` and records the first `IS` response. Used as a hint for PETSCII / ANSI / ASCII detection. |
| **RFC 1143** | Q-Method of Option Negotiation | Per-option tracking of advertised DO / WILL / DONT prevents the classic negotiation loop. |

Options not negotiated (BINARY, LINEMODE, ENVIRON, NEW-ENVIRON, TSPEED,
COM-PORT, CHARSET) are explicitly refused with WONT / DONT so the peer
doesn't stall waiting for an answer.

#### Outgoing Telnet Gateway

The Telnet Gateway menu (and internally the RFC 854/855 side of `ATDT
host:port` when used for file transfer) dials out to remote telnet servers.
Compliance operates in two modes controlled by the `telnet_gateway_negotiate`
config flag:

**Reactive mode (default, `telnet_gateway_negotiate = false`)**

The gateway does not send any proactive negotiation offers, so raw-TCP
services on port 23 (legacy MUDs, hand-rolled BBS software, etc.) are not
poked with IAC bytes they don't understand.  It still does:

- Escape outbound 0xFF data bytes as `IAC IAC` so literal 0xFF survives
  the wire without being mistaken for the start of an IAC sequence.
- Parse inbound IAC from the remote and silently consume 2-byte commands
  (NOP, DM, BRK, IP, AO, AYT, EC, EL, GA) and subnegotiation bodies
  instead of leaking them into the user's terminal.
- Accept peer's `WILL ECHO` with `DO ECHO` (always on — raw-TCP services
  never send `WILL ECHO`, so this is safe in both modes).  This fixes the
  silent-typing failure on BBSes that expect the server to echo.
- Refuse every other peer-initiated option: `WILL <opt>` → `DONT <opt>`,
  `DO <opt>` → `WONT <opt>`.  Refusals are one-shot per cycle (RFC 1143
  spirit) so a persistent remote can't drive us into a loop.

**Raw-TCP escape hatch (`telnet_gateway_raw = true`)**

When set, the gateway bypasses its entire telnet-IAC layer: no IAC
escaping on outbound, no IAC parsing on inbound, no negotiation.
Intended for destinations that clearly aren't telnet at all (legacy
MUDs, hand-rolled BBS software).  Supersedes `telnet_gateway_negotiate`.
The Telnet Gateway menu shows the current mode and lets you toggle it
with a single keystroke; the change is saved to `egateway.conf` so future
sessions start in the selected mode.  Bytes written to the local user
are still IAC-escaped so their telnet client doesn't misinterpret a
stray 0xFF as a protocol byte.

**Cooperative mode (`telnet_gateway_negotiate = true`)**

In addition to everything reactive mode does, the gateway:

- Sends `IAC WILL TTYPE`, `IAC WILL NAWS`, and `IAC DO ECHO` as proactive
  offers at connect time, so BBSes that wait for the client to ask first
  still get echo, terminal-type adaptation, and window-size awareness.
- Responds to `SB TTYPE SEND` with `SB TTYPE IS PETSCII` / `ANSI` / `DUMB`
  depending on the local user's terminal type, so remotes can serve
  appropriate content.
- Responds to `DO NAWS` with `WILL NAWS` plus an immediate `SB NAWS`
  carrying the local user's actual window dimensions (from their own
  NAWS, or terminal-type defaults: 40×25 for PETSCII, 80×24 for ANSI /
  ASCII).  Any 0xFF byte in the width/height is properly IAC-doubled.
- **Forwards NAWS updates mid-session**: if the local user resizes their
  terminal during a gateway session, the new dimensions are captured
  from their `IAC SB NAWS` subnegotiation and relayed to the remote
  server as an updated `SB NAWS`.
- Tracks each option through a **full RFC 1143 six-state Q-method**
  (`No` / `Yes` / `WantYes` / `WantYesOpposite` / `WantNo` /
  `WantNoOpposite`), so mind-changes while a prior WILL or DO is in
  flight resolve cleanly instead of racing into inconsistent state.

The gateway never waits for a reply to any message it sends, so silent
or partially-compliant remote servers do not cause it to stall.  Enable
cooperative mode when dialing real telnet servers; leave it off for
compatibility with raw-TCP destinations.

### Hayes AT Command Set

See [Hayes Compliance Summary](#hayes-compliance-summary) in the Modem
Emulator section for a full command inventory and the three gateway-friendly
default deviations (`AT&D0`, `AT&K0`, `S7=15`).

## Prerequisites

### Debian 13 / Ubuntu

Install build dependencies and the Rust toolchain:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config cmake curl libudev-dev
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the prompts (press 1 for the default installation). Then load the
environment into your current shell:

```sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### Fedora / RHEL / AlmaLinux

```sh
sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ make cmake pkg-config curl
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### Arch Linux

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake curl
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### Windows

1. Download and run the rustup installer from https://rustup.rs
2. When prompted, install the Visual Studio C++ Build Tools (required)
3. Open a new terminal after installation completes

`cmake` is also required. Install it from https://cmake.org/download/ or via
winget:

```
winget install Kitware.CMake
```

### macOS

```sh
xcode-select --install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
brew install cmake
```

### Verify Installation

```sh
rustc --version    # should show 1.85.0 or later
cargo --version
cmake --version
```

## Building

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/ethernet-gateway`.

## Verifying Releases

Pre-built binaries are published to the [GitHub Releases][releases] page
for Linux (x86_64), macOS (aarch64), and Windows (x86_64). Every release
ships with:

- The binary archive (`ethernet-gateway-vX.Y.Z-<target>.tar.gz` or `.zip`).
- A SHA-256 checksum (`<archive>.sha256`).
- Optionally a detached GPG signature (`<archive>.asc`) — produced if the
  release signer has a GPG key configured.
- A [Sigstore][sigstore] keyless signature (`<archive>.sig` +
  `<archive>.pem`) bound to the publisher's GitHub identity. Produced on
  every release automatically; no key management required.

[releases]: https://github.com/rickybryce/ethernet-gateway/releases
[sigstore]: https://www.sigstore.dev/

### Verifying the checksum

```sh
sha256sum -c ethernet-gateway-v0.6.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.sha256
```

### Verifying the GPG signature (if present)

```sh
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys <KEY_FINGERPRINT>
gpg --verify \
    ethernet-gateway-v0.6.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.asc \
    ethernet-gateway-v0.6.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

### Verifying the Sigstore signature

[`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) is required (one-time install,
free):

```sh
cosign verify-blob \
    --certificate ethernet-gateway-v0.6.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.pem \
    --signature   ethernet-gateway-v0.6.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.sig \
    --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/rickybryce/ethernet-gateway/.*" \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
    ethernet-gateway-v0.6.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

This ties the binary to a specific GitHub Actions workflow run on
this repository.

### OS-level trust prompts

Neither Windows `.exe` nor macOS `.app` bundles ship with commercial
code-signing certificates (those cost $100–400/year and aren't in scope
for a hobby project). As a result:

- **Windows**: SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC"; click
  *More info* → *Run anyway*. Verify the SHA-256 and GPG/Sigstore
  signature first.
- **macOS**: Gatekeeper shows "cannot be opened because the developer
  cannot be verified"; right-click → *Open* → *Open*, or remove the
  quarantine attribute with `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <path>`.
- **Linux**: no equivalent prompt; just verify and run.

If this causes friction in your environment, build from source
(`cargo build --release`) — the result is identical modulo build
reproducibility.

## Running

```sh
./ethernet-gateway
```

On first run, a default configuration file `egateway.conf` is created in the
working directory. The telnet server listens on port 2323 by default.

Connect with any telnet client:

```sh
telnet <server-ip> 2323
```

Or, if the SSH interface is enabled, connect with any SSH client:

```sh
ssh <ssh-user>@<server-ip> -p 2222
```

### Running as a systemd Service (Linux)

A hardened systemd unit file is provided at
[`contrib/systemd/ethernet-gateway.service`](contrib/systemd/ethernet-gateway.service).
To install:

```sh
# Create a dedicated unprivileged user
sudo useradd --system --home-dir /var/lib/ethernet-gateway \
             --shell /usr/sbin/nologin ethernet-gateway
sudo install -d -m 0750 -o ethernet-gateway -g ethernet-gateway \
             /var/lib/ethernet-gateway

# Install the binary
sudo install -m 0755 target/release/ethernet-gateway /usr/local/bin/

# Install and start the service
sudo install -m 0644 contrib/systemd/ethernet-gateway.service \
             /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now ethernet-gateway.service

# Watch the log
journalctl -u ethernet-gateway -f
```

The unit ships with defensive hardening enabled by default:
`NoNewPrivileges`, `PrivateTmp`, `ProtectSystem=strict`,
`ProtectHome`, namespace restrictions, `SystemCallFilter=@system-service`,
capability bounding, and a 512 MiB memory cap.  Edit the file to
loosen anything that breaks your deployment.

Set the telnet server port below 1024 (e.g. 23) by uncommenting the
`CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` line and matching
`AmbientCapabilities`.

## GUI Configuration Editor

When `enable_console = true` (the default), a graphical configuration window
opens on startup. The GUI provides:

- **Live console output** -- server log messages stream in the bottom panel
- **Configuration editing** -- all `egateway.conf` settings can be changed and
  saved without editing the file by hand
- **Two independent serial ports** -- the Serial Port frame has a header row
  with **Enabled** checkboxes for both **Port A** and **Port B**, plus a
  shared **Save** button.  Each port has its own row beneath the header
  with a device-path dropdown (auto-detected; refresh button to re-scan)
  and a baud field.  Each row's **More...** button opens that port's
  advanced popup, where you select the **Mode** (*Modem (AT Command)
  Mode* or *Telnet-Serial Mode* — see Console Mode below), framing,
  flow control, and the full Hayes AT-state surface.  The two popups
  are independent so you can compare settings side-by-side.
- **"More..." popups** -- the Server, File Transfer, AI/Browser/Weather,
  and per-port Serial Port frames each have a **More...** button that opens
  an advanced-options window. The Server popup holds the session cap, idle
  timeout, GUI display scale, gateway modes, and the **Master/Slave** relay
  settings; the File Transfer popup exposes the XMODEM-family timeouts plus
  the independent ZMODEM tunables (handshake, frame timeout, retry cap) side
  by side; the AI/Browser/Weather popup holds the weather location and units.
- **User Manual button** -- opens the PDF user manual on GitHub in your browser
- **Save and Restart Server** -- writes changes to `egateway.conf` and restarts
  the server so all changes (including security, ports, and credentials) take
  effect immediately

The GUI window closes automatically when the server receives a shutdown signal
(Ctrl+C, SIGTERM, SIGHUP) or when the Save and Restart Server button is
clicked (the GUI reopens after the restart completes). Closing the GUI window
does **not** stop the server -- it continues running headless until a shutdown
signal is received.

To disable the GUI, set `enable_console = false` in `egateway.conf` or uncheck
"Show GUI on Startup" in the Other Settings section and save.

## Main Menu

After connecting and completing terminal detection (and login, if security is
enabled), the main menu offers:

```
  A  AI Chat
  B  Simple Browser
  C  Configuration
  F  File Transfer
  G  Serial Gateway
  R  Troubleshooting
  S  SSH Gateway
  T  Telnet Gateway
  W  Weather
  X  Exit
```

The **Serial Gateway** option appears whenever **at least one** of the
two serial ports (Port A or Port B) is configured in **console mode**
(see Console Mode below).  Picking it opens an A/B picker showing both
ports' status; the bridge is then established to whichever port you
choose, and your telnet/SSH session becomes a transparent pipe to the
wire in both directions.  Press **ESC** twice to leave the bridge and
return to the menu.

## Configuration

Most settings can be changed from within a telnet or SSH session using the
**C** (Configuration) menu, which provides submenus for:

- **E** Security -- toggle login requirement, set the unified username /
  password used by telnet, SSH, and the configuration web UI
- **G** Gateway Configuration -- outbound Telnet and SSH Gateway options
- **M** Serial Configuration -- opens an A/B picker submenu listing both
  ports with their current status (Disabled / Modem mode / Console
  mode).  Pick a port to enter that port's settings menu, where you
  can toggle its mode (the per-port **T** item flips between Modem
  Emulator and Serial Console), set its device, baud, framing, flow
  control, AT-state, dialup mapping, and ring emulator.  The screen also
  has two gateway-wide toggles: **D** (gateway debug trace) and **P**
  (peer-dial, `allow_peer_dial`).  Each port's settings are fully
  independent and persist under separate `serial_a_*` / `serial_b_*` keys
  in `egateway.conf`.
- **S** Server Configuration -- enable/disable the telnet, SSH, Kermit, and
  web listeners and set each one's port, set the session cap (**C**) and idle
  timeout (**D**, `0` disables it), toggle the network-safety opt-out
  (`disable_ip_safety`), restart the server, and open the **M Master/Slave**
  sub-screen (role, master host/port/credentials, "accept relays" toggle).
  See **Master/Slave Serial Extender** below.
- **F** File Transfer -- submenu with shared transfer directory and
  per-protocol settings pages:
  - **X** XMODEM settings -- negotiation timeout, retry interval
    (C/NAK poke cadence), block timeout, and retry limit (shared with
    XMODEM-1K and YMODEM, which use the same protocol code)
  - **Y** YMODEM settings -- same keys as XMODEM; page calls out the
    shared-family behavior
  - **Z** ZMODEM settings -- independent handshake timeout, retry
    interval (ZRINIT/ZRQINIT re-send cadence), per-frame read timeout,
    and ZRQINIT/ZRPOS/ZDATA retry cap
  - **K** Kermit settings -- standalone-listener toggle and port,
    `allow_atdt_kermit`, plus the protocol-tuning surface (negotiation
    timeout, packet timeout, idle timeout, max retries, max packet
    length, window size, block-check type, capability flags, resume,
    locking shifts, 8-bit quoting). See the
    [Kermit Reference](http://ethernetgateway.com/kermit.html) for
    the full discussion of each tunable.
  - **P** Punter settings -- negotiation timeout and retry interval,
    per-block timeout, retry limit, max bad-block rounds, block size,
    and the hang-up-on-failure toggle (drops carrier on give-up, since
    C1 has no in-band abort to free a stranded C64)
- **O** Other Settings -- AI API key, browser homepage, weather location, verbose
  logging, GUI on startup, gateway debug trace
- **R** Reset Defaults -- restore all settings to factory defaults

All settings are persisted to `egateway.conf` automatically. You can also edit
`egateway.conf` by hand. All options:

# kermit_window_size:          sliding-window depth (1..=31).  1 = stop-and-wait.
# kermit_block_check_type:     1 = 6-bit checksum, 2 = 12-bit, 3 = CRC-16/KERMIT.
# kermit_long_packets:         advertise long-packet capability.
# kermit_sliding_windows:      advertise sliding-window capability.

# kermit_repeat_compression:   use repeat-count compression (RLE).

# kermit_resume_partial:       resume partial uploads (spec disposition='R').
#                              Off by default; turn on only when the peer is
#                              known to honor disposition='R' in the A-packet
#                              ACK, otherwise the transfer can corrupt the
#                              file.
# kermit_resume_max_age_hours: ignore on-disk partials older than this when
#                              deciding whether to resume.  168 = one week.
# kermit_locking_shifts:       advertise SO/SI region-shift capability for
#                              8-bit transit on 7-bit links (Frank da Cruz
#                              §3.4.5).  Off by default — no modern Kermit

```

### Setting Up Authentication

To require a username and password, either use the in-app Configuration menu
(**C** > **E** Security) or edit `egateway.conf` by hand:

1. Open `egateway.conf` in a text editor
2. Set `security_enabled = true`
3. Change `username` and `password` to your desired credentials
4. Restart the server

When enabled, users must authenticate after terminal detection. Failed login
attempts are tracked per IP address -- after 3 failures, the IP is locked out
for 5 minutes.

**Note:** Credentials are stored in plaintext in `egateway.conf`. This is
consistent with the telnet protocol itself, which transmits all data
(including passwords) in cleartext. Do not reuse sensitive passwords here.
This authentication is intended as a lightweight access control for private
networks, not as a security boundary.

### Setting Up AI Chat

The AI Chat feature uses the [Groq API](https://groq.com), which provides free
access to fast LLM inference. To enable it:

1. Go to https://console.groq.com and create a free account
2. Navigate to **API Keys** and generate a new key (starts with `gsk_`)
3. Set the key via Configuration > Other Settings > **A** (Set AI API key), or
   open `egateway.conf` and set: `groq_api_key = gsk_your_key_here`
4. Restart the server

If no API key is configured, selecting AI Chat from the menu will display
instructions on how to obtain one.

### Setting Up the Browser Homepage

The browser loads `http://telnetbible.com` by default. To change it, use
Configuration > Other Settings > **B** (Set browser homepage), or edit
`egateway.conf`:

1. Open `egateway.conf`
2. Set `browser_homepage` to a URL, e.g.: `browser_homepage = example.com`
3. Restart the server

## Terminal Support

On connect, the server asks the user to press **Backspace** to detect the
terminal type:

| Byte received | Terminal type | Description |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| 0x14          | PETSCII       | Commodore 64 (40-column, single-byte color codes) |
| 0x08 or 0x7F  | ANSI          | Modern terminal with escape sequence color |
| Other         | ASCII         | Plain text, no color |

After detection, the server asks whether to enable color. The user must press
Y or N to continue; no default is applied.

## Transferring Files

### Supported Protocols

The gateway implements six file-transfer protocols, selectable per-transfer
from menus on the gateway side:

| Protocol | Block size | CRC | Direction | Notes |
|----------|------------|-----|-----------|-------|
| **XMODEM** | 128 B (SOH) | CRC-16 or checksum | up/down | Auto-detects CRC vs. checksum on receive; classic single-file. |
| **XMODEM-1K** | 1024 B (STX) | CRC-16 | up/down | Download option; on upload the XMODEM/YMODEM branch accepts STX blocks transparently. Opportunistically falls back to SOH if the peer NAKs the first STX. |
| **YMODEM** | 1024 B + block-0 header | CRC-16 | up/down | Block 0 carries filename + size; the receive path auto-detects it. |
| **ZMODEM** | variable subpackets (1 K default) | CRC-16 out, CRC-16 or CRC-32 in | up/down | Full Forsberg spec: ZRQINIT handshake, ZDLE escaping, ZSKIP, batch sends and receives. On upload the first file is saved under the name you entered; subsequent files in a batch use the sender's filename (validated, collisions skipped via ZSKIP). The one optional frame deliberately not implemented is `ZCOMMAND` (remote command execution) — it is always refused for security; use SSH for shell access. |
| **Kermit** | configurable long packets (4096 default) | 6-bit / 12-bit checksum or CRC-16/KERMIT | up/down + server | Columbia spec — sliding windows, attribute packets, RESEND, locking shifts, 8-bit quoting. Both **client** (push/pull from the menu) and **server** (idle in the file-transfer menu's `K` slot, on the standalone TCP listener, or via `ATDT KERMIT`) modes. See the [Kermit Reference](http://ethernetgateway.com/kermit.html) for the full surface. |
| **Punter** | 255 B blocks, 248 B payload (configurable down to 40) | dual checksum — 16-bit additive + cyclic rotate-left | up/down | C1 "New Punter" — the protocol CCGMS / Novaterm / StrikeTerm speak natively on Commodore BBSes. Two-phase transfer (type block then data blocks) with a 3-byte ASCII handshake. C1 has no in-band abort, so a stalled give-up can optionally drop carrier (`punter_hangup_on_failure`) to free a stranded C64. |

On upload, the gateway offers **XMODEM / YMODEM** (variant auto-detected),
**ZMODEM**, **Kermit**, or **Punter**. On download, you pick the specific
variant you want, including Kermit and Punter. Kermit also has a dedicated
server mode (press **K**
on the File Transfer menu) and a standalone TCP listener (set
`kermit_server_enabled = true` in `egateway.conf`).

### Uploading a File to the Server

1. Connect via telnet and navigate to **F** (File Transfer)
2. Press **U** (Upload)
3. Enter a filename (letters, numbers, dots, hyphens, underscores only; max 64
   characters; cannot start with a dot, cannot contain `..`, must include at
   least one letter or digit)
4. On the **SELECT UPLOAD PROTOCOL** screen, press **X** (XMODEM / YMODEM —
   block size, CRC mode, and batch header are auto-detected), **Z** (ZMODEM),
   **K** (Kermit, any flavor — see the
   [Kermit Reference](http://ethernetgateway.com/kermit.html)), or **P**
   (Punter — Commodore C1)
5. The server displays "Start XMODEM/YMODEM send now", "Start ZMODEM send
   now", "Start Kermit send now", or "Start PUNTER send … now" and waits for
   the negotiation handshake
6. In your terminal client, start the matching upload
   - Most terminal programs have a "Send File" or "Upload" option under a
     Transfer or File menu
   - ExtraPutty: **File Transfer → Zmodem → Send**; SyncTerm: **Ctrl-PgUp**;
     Kermit: `kermit -s file` or the equivalent client UI
7. On completion, the server reports bytes, blocks, and elapsed time. For
   ZMODEM and Kermit batches, every file the sender transmits is listed
   (saved or skipped)

### Downloading a File from the Server

1. Navigate to **F** (File Transfer), then press **D** (Download)
2. The server lists files in the current transfer directory (paginated, 10 per
   page)
3. Enter the number of the file to download
4. On the **SELECT PROTOCOL** screen, choose **X** (XMODEM), **1** (XMODEM-1K),
   **Y** (YMODEM), **Z** (ZMODEM), **K** (Kermit), or **P** (Punter)
5. The server prompts "Start *protocol* receive now" and waits for the peer
   to begin
6. In your terminal client, start the matching receive and choose where to
   save the file locally (ZMODEM auto-starts in most modern terminals; for
   Kermit, run `kermit -r` or the equivalent client UI)
7. On completion, the server reports the transfer result

### Other File Operations

- **X** -- Delete a file (with confirmation)
- **C** -- Change to a subdirectory within the transfer directory
- **K** -- Kermit server mode: idle and wait for a Kermit client's commands
  (`get`, `send`, `dir`, `cwd`, `finish`, etc.). See the
  [Kermit Reference](http://ethernetgateway.com/kermit.html) for the full
  G-subcommand table.
- **I** -- Toggle IAC escaping on/off (needed when transferring binary files
  over telnet that contain 0xFF bytes)

### IAC Escaping

Telnet reserves byte 0xFF as the IAC (Interpret As Command) marker. When
transferring binary files that may contain 0xFF, enable IAC escaping with the
**I** toggle in the File Transfer menu. Both the server and your terminal client
must agree on whether IAC escaping is active. For text files or when your client
handles this automatically, leave it off (the default).

## SSH Server

The SSH server provides encrypted access to the same gateway menus and features
available over telnet. This is useful when connecting from modern clients where
encryption is preferred over plaintext telnet.

### Enabling the SSH Server

Use Configuration > Server Configuration to toggle SSH and set the port, and
Configuration > Security to set the login credentials. Or edit `egateway.conf`
by hand:

1. Set `ssh_enabled = true`
2. Change `username` and `password` to your desired credentials (the same pair
   is used by telnet, SSH, and the web configuration UI)
3. Optionally change `ssh_port` (default 2222)
4. Restart the server

On first start with SSH enabled, the server generates an Ed25519 host key and
saves it to `ethernet_ssh_host_key` in the working directory. This key is reused
on subsequent starts so that clients can verify the server's identity.

### Connecting

```sh
ssh <username>@<server-ip> -p 2222
```

After authenticating, you are presented with the same Ethernet Gateway menu
system as a telnet connection, using ANSI terminal mode. All features (file
transfer, SSH/telnet gateway, browser, AI chat, modem emulator, weather) are
available.

### SSH, Telnet, and Web UI Credentials

A single `username` / `password` pair in `egateway.conf` is used by **all
three** authenticated interfaces — the telnet menu, the SSH server, and the
configuration web UI.  The factory defaults are `admin` / `changeme`; change
them via Configuration > Security in the telnet menu, the Security frame in the
GUI / web UI, or by editing `egateway.conf` directly.

If you're upgrading from a release that still had the separate
`ssh_username` / `ssh_password` keys, the first time the new server reads your
config those legacy values are migrated into the unified pair *only* when the
unified pair is still at the factory defaults — so a setup that customised the
SSH login keeps working without intervention.  Once the next save runs, the
legacy keys are dropped from the file.

Three failed logins from the same source IP — across any of telnet, SSH, or
the web UI — trip a 5-minute lockout that affects all three protocols.

**Note:** credentials in `egateway.conf` are stored in plaintext. While SSH
and HTTPS-fronted access to the web UI would be encrypted on the wire, the
config file is not. Protect it with appropriate file permissions.

## SSH Gateway

The SSH Gateway allows you to connect through the server to a remote SSH host.
This is useful for accessing SSH servers from terminals that only support telnet
(such as a Commodore 64).

1. From the main menu, press **S** (SSH Gateway)
2. Optionally press **K** at the first prompt to display the gateway's public
   key (see *Public-Key Authentication* below)
3. Enter the remote host, port (default 22), and username
4. The gateway attempts public-key authentication using its own keypair first
5. If the remote doesn't trust the gateway key, you are prompted for a password
6. Once connected, you have a full interactive shell on the remote server
7. Press **ESC** twice to disconnect from the SSH session

The server acts as a proxy between your telnet client and the remote SSH server.
All input is forwarded to the SSH session, and all output is sent back to your
terminal. Telnet line-ending conventions (CR+LF, CR+NUL) are automatically
normalized to bare CR for SSH compatibility.

For PETSCII and ASCII terminals, ANSI escape sequences from the remote host are
automatically stripped, and text is converted to the appropriate encoding. ANSI
terminals receive the raw output unmodified. The PTY size is set to 40x25 for
PETSCII and 80x24 for ANSI/ASCII terminals.

### Public-Key Authentication

On the first outbound SSH dial, the gateway generates an Ed25519 client keypair
and stores it as `ethernet_gateway_ssh_key` (0o600 on Unix). Every subsequent
dial tries public-key authentication with this key *before* falling back to a
password prompt. If the remote accepts the key, you skip the password prompt
entirely — identical to how OpenSSH from the command line behaves.

To set up passwordless login to a particular remote:

1. Open the SSH Gateway menu and press **K** — the gateway's public key is
   displayed in the standard `ssh-ed25519 AAAA…` OpenSSH format.
2. Copy that line into the remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
3. Future dials to that host skip the password prompt.

If the remote doesn't have the gateway's key in its `authorized_keys`, you see
a one-line notice (`Pubkey not accepted — password required.`) and the
password prompt appears as before.

### Host-Key Verification

The first time you dial a new SSH server, the gateway shows the server's
SHA-256 fingerprint and asks whether to trust it (TOFU — trust-on-first-use).
If accepted, the fingerprint is saved to `gateway_hosts` (0o600 on Unix) and
checked on every subsequent dial. A changed key produces a prominent
`WARNING: HOST KEY HAS CHANGED!` with the option to update or abort.

All host-key trust decisions (first-time accept, update, and reject) are
written to the server log so there is a forensic trail if a key change turns
out to be a man-in-the-middle attempt.

### SSH Gateway vs SSH Server

`gateway_hosts` holds the *remote* servers' public keys (similar to an OpenSSH
client's `~/.ssh/known_hosts`). `ethernet_ssh_host_key` is the Ethernet Gateway's
*own* SSH server host key. `ethernet_gateway_ssh_key` is the gateway's outgoing-
client keypair used for public-key authentication to remote servers. All three
are independent.

## Master/Slave Serial Extender

A **slave** gateway can extend its serial ports to a **master** gateway over the
master's SSH port, so a serial-attached device reaches the master's menu, file
transfer, and dial-out as if it were attached to the master directly. **Files
always land on the master.** The feature is entirely inert by default
(`gateway_role = standalone`); a standalone gateway is unchanged.

**Set up the master:** enable the SSH server (`ssh_enabled = true`), set
`gateway_role = master`, and turn on `master_accept_relays`. No per-slave
configuration — the master accepts relay connections on its existing SSH port
alongside normal SSH logins. (If you set master + accept-relays but leave SSH
disabled, startup warns, because relays ride the SSH server.)

**Set up the slave:** set `gateway_role = slave`, point `slave_master_host` /
`slave_master_port` at the master (port defaults to the SSH port, 2222), and
enter `slave_master_username` / `slave_master_password` — which **must match the
master's unified username/password**. The slave pins the master's SSH host key
on first contact (TOFU, in `gateway_hosts`) and refuses a changed key. All of
this is editable from the **Configuration > S Server > M Master/Slave**
sub-screen (telnet/SSH), and the Server "More…" popup in both the web config
page and the GUI.

Each serial port relays according to its own mode:

- **Modem-mode port** — the slave runs the Hayes emulator locally; when the
  device dials (e.g. `ATDT ethernet-gateway`, or a number in the slave's *local*
  dial map), the slave bridges the call to the master, which serves its menu or
  dials the resolved `host:port` onward (the slave's local phonebook resolves;
  the master dials). Onward-dial requires the master's `allow_peer_dial` to be
  on — otherwise the master refuses the outbound connection. `+++`/`ATO` work
  (see **Relay limitations** below for the menu-relay idle-timeout caveat).
- **Console-mode port** — the slave registers the port with the master and a
  master user reaches it from the master's **Serial Gateway** menu, which lists
  local ports plus registered remote ports. (A slave's *own* Serial Gateway menu
  shows its relayed console port as "→ master".)

**Each gateway's serial ports are configured on the gateway they are physically
attached to.** A slave's ports use the *slave's* own `serial_a_*` / `serial_b_*`
settings (device path, baud, mode, flow control, `drive_carrier`, S-registers,
`AT&W`); the master's local ports use the *master's*. The relay carries the
session — the byte stream, and for a console port its label — **not** the port
configuration. So set each device's baud/mode/etc. on the gateway it is wired
to; there is no per-slave serial config on the master.

In slave mode the gateway still serves its own telnet/SSH, and the main menu
shows a "SLAVE mode: ports relay to master" notice with the master's address.
The slave reconnects automatically if the link drops. Only the SSH transport is
implemented (`relay_transport = ssh`).

### Relay limitations

A few relay behaviors are worth knowing:

- **SSH is the only implemented transport.** `relay_transport = raw` is
  accepted in the config (reserved for a future raw-serial transport) but
  always falls back to SSH, and startup logs a warning if you set it. No UI
  exposes the key.
- **`+++`/`ATO` on a *menu* relay is bounded by the master's idle timeout.**
  When a device escapes a relayed *menu* call with `+++`, the SSH connection is
  kept alive so `ATO` can resume it — but the master-side session still obeys
  `idle_timeout_secs`, so an `ATO` issued after the master session has idled out
  returns `NO CARRIER` (just redial). An onward *dial* relay (`host:port`) is a
  transparent pipe with no such timeout.
- **Onward-dial targets must be a hostname or IPv4 address.** A bracketed IPv6
  literal (e.g. `[2001:db8::1]:23`) is not supported as a relay onward-dial
  destination.
- **A modem-mode relay reports only `NO CARRIER` on any failure.** Master
  unreachable, wrong credentials, protocol-version skew, or a number that
  isn't in the *slave's* dial map all surface identically as `NO CARRIER` at
  the device — the specific cause is in the **slave's** server log, so check
  there when a relay dial won't connect.
- **Relay and console-registration channels count against the master's
  `max_sessions`.** Each active relay call *and each idle console-port
  registration* consumes one master session slot, so size `max_sessions` to
  cover your slaves' registered ports plus interactive telnet/SSH/web users; a
  master at capacity refuses further relays (the slave sees a refusal and backs
  off).
- **Master and slave must run a compatible relay protocol version.** A skewed
  pair refuses to relay (the log says "upgrade the older gateway"); keep both
  gateways on the same release.
- **A changed master SSH host key strands a slave until you clear it.** The
  slave pins the master's key on first contact and, if it later *changes* (e.g.
  the master was reinstalled), refuses to reconnect as a possible MITM and
  backs off — it is headless, so it cannot prompt like the interactive SSH
  Gateway does. Delete the master's entry from the slave's `gateway_hosts` file
  to let it re-pin.
- **Role and relay settings apply at server startup.** Changing `gateway_role`
  or `master_accept_relays` (or the slave's master address) takes effect on the
  next server restart, not live — the telnet Master/Slave screen shows a restart
  reminder; web/GUI users must restart the server themselves. An unrecognized
  `gateway_role` or `relay_transport` value (or `slave_master_port = 0`) is
  silently reset to its default with no error.
- **A slave retries with a failure-aware backoff and won't lock out its own
  IP.** Transient network errors retry briskly (1→30 s), a wrong-credential
  rejection backs off ~6 min (deliberately longer than the master's 5-minute
  per-IP lockout window, so a misconfigured slave never trips the ban against
  its own host), and a relays-declined master is re-checked every ~60 s. A dead
  link (silent freeze) is detected within ~2 minutes via SSH keepalive.

## Telnet Gateway

The Telnet Gateway connects through the server to a remote telnet host. This is
useful for accessing BBS systems or other telnet services from retro terminals.

1. From the main menu, press **T** (Telnet Gateway)
2. At the mode prompt, press **T** to toggle between `Telnet protocol` and
   `Raw TCP` mode if needed (see below), or any other key to continue
3. Enter the remote host and port (default 23)
4. Once connected, all input and output is proxied between your terminal and the
   remote server
5. Press **ESC** twice to disconnect

For PETSCII and ASCII terminals, ANSI escape sequences from the remote host are
automatically filtered.

### Protocol Modes

The gateway has three modes of operation, all documented in the [Telnet RFCs](#telnet-rfcs)
section above. In short:

- **Telnet protocol (default)** — the gateway parses IAC framing in both
  directions, accepts cooperative ECHO from the remote, refuses other options.
  Works with any real telnet server.
- **Cooperative mode** (`telnet_gateway_negotiate = true` in `egateway.conf`) —
  adds proactive TTYPE, NAWS, and DO ECHO offers so modern BBSes can adapt
  content and render full-screen layouts at your actual window size.
- **Raw TCP** (toggled with **T** at the gateway menu, saved persistently) —
  the IAC layer is disabled entirely. Use this when dialing destinations that
  don't speak telnet at all (legacy MUDs, hand-rolled BBS software, some
  services on port 23). The toggle persists to `egateway.conf` so you only need
  to set it once per destination type.

## Modem Emulator

The modem emulator provides Hayes AT command emulation on a physical serial
port. This allows retro hardware (Commodore 64, CP/M machines, etc.) to connect
to the gateway and to remote telnet hosts using a serial connection and standard
modem commands.

The gateway exposes **two physically independent ports**, **Port A** and
**Port B**.  Each port is fully independent — its own enabled flag,
mode, device, baud, AT/S-register state, and stored phone-number
slots — so you can run a Hayes modem on one port and a telnet-serial
bridge on the other (or two modems, or two bridges) at the same time.

Each port can run in one of two modes:

- **Modem (AT Command) Mode** (default) — runs the Hayes emulator described
  below.
- **Telnet-Serial Mode** — keeps the port idle until a telnet/SSH user
  selects **G  Serial Gateway** from the main menu and picks this
  port, at which point the session is bridged directly to the wire.
  See **Console Mode** below.

The mode is per-port: the **Mode** dropdown inside each port's GUI
"More..." popup, and the per-port **T** (Toggle Modem/Console mode)
item in the telnet **Configuration > M (Serial Configuration) >
Port A or B** submenu, both switch a single port between the two
modes.  The setting persists under `serial_a_mode` / `serial_b_mode`
in `egateway.conf`.

### Setting Up

1. From the main menu, press **C** (Configuration)
2. Press **M** (Serial Configuration) to open the A/B picker
3. Press **A** or **B** to enter that port's settings menu
4. Press **T** if needed to switch between **Modem** mode (default)
   and **Console** mode for the port you're editing
5. Press **E** to enable the port
6. Press **S** to select a serial device (auto-detected)
7. Configure baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, and flow control as needed
8. Press **Q** to apply -- settings take effect immediately (no restart needed)

Or edit `egateway.conf` directly under the `serial_a_*` / `serial_b_*`
keys and restart the server.

> **Device names can move — port settings don't.** A port's *settings* (mode,

> (`ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/`), and re-check each port's device after any
> re-cabling.

| `A/`    | Repeat the last command (no `AT` prefix, no CR required) |
| `+++`   | Return to command mode (with guard time from S12) |

Unrecognized commands (`ATB`, `ATC`, `ATL`, `ATM`, `AT&B`, `AT&G`, `AT&J`,
`AT&S`, `AT&T`, `AT&Y`, etc.) are accepted and return `OK` so that legacy
init strings don't halt with `ERROR` on commands the emulator has no
hardware to implement.

**Dial modifiers** inside phone-number dial strings:

| Modifier | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `,` | Pause for S8 seconds (default 2s) before continuing |
| `W` | Wait for dial tone (adds S6 seconds, virtual) |
| `;` | After dial, return to command mode instead of going online |
| `*`, `#` | DTMF digits, preserved for phone-number lookup |
| `P`, `T`, `@`, `!` | Pulse/tone/quiet/hookflash selectors, ignored |

Modifiers are only honored when the dial string looks like a phone number.
Hostnames like `pine.example.com` or `www.example.com` are not stripped.

**Result codes and ATX levels:** In verbose mode (default) results are text
(`OK`, `CONNECT`, `NO CARRIER`, `ERROR`). In numeric mode (`ATV0`) results are
digits. Quiet mode (`ATQ1`) suppresses all result codes. The ATX level
controls which codes the modem may emit and whether `CONNECT` includes the
line speed:

| Level | Extended codes | CONNECT format |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| X0 | Basic only; BUSY / NO DIALTONE / NO ANSWER collapse to NO CARRIER | `CONNECT` (code 1) |
| X1 | Basic + baud in CONNECT | `CONNECT <baud>` (code per baud) |
| X2 | Adds NO DIALTONE detection | `CONNECT <baud>` |
| X3 | Adds BUSY detection | `CONNECT <baud>` |
| X4 | Full extended set (gateway default) | `CONNECT <baud>` |

Numeric `CONNECT` codes follow Hayes conventions: 1 = 300, 5 = 1200,
10 = 2400, 12 = 9600, 16 = 19200, 28 = 38400, 87 = 115200. Non-standard
baud rates fall back to code 1.

**S-registers:** Query with `ATSn?`, set with `ATSn=v`, or type `ATS?` for help.
`AT&W` saves all registers to `egateway.conf`; `ATZ` restores saved values;
`AT&F` resets to gateway-friendly factory defaults.

| Register | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| S0  | 5   | Auto-answer ring count (0 = disabled) |
| S1  | 0   | Ring counter (current) |
| S2  | 43  | Escape character (43 = `+`) |
| S3  | 13  | Carriage return character |
| S4  | 10  | Line feed character |
| S5  | 8   | Backspace character |
| S6  | 2   | Wait for dial tone (seconds) |
| S7  | **15** | Wait for carrier (seconds) — Hayes default is 50; reduced here so failed dials return quickly. Capped internally at 60 s. |
| S8  | 2   | Comma pause time (seconds) |
| S9  | 6   | Carrier detect response time (1/10s) |
| S10 | 14  | Carrier loss disconnect time (1/10s) |
| S11 | 95  | DTMF tone duration (milliseconds) |
| S12 | 50  | Escape guard time (1/50s; 50 = 1 second) |
| S13–S24 | 0 | Reserved. Stored and persisted so legacy init strings that probe these registers don't halt with `ERROR`, but they have no effect on the emulator. |
| S25 | 5   | DTR detect time (1/100s). Reserved — no DTR pin. |
| S26 | 1   | RTS-to-CTS delay (1/100s). Reserved — no RTS/CTS pins. |

Keep `S3`, `S4`, and `S5` at distinct values. Command-mode line editing
dispatches on the raw byte: the CR branch is checked before BS, so setting
`S3 = 8` would cause backspace to terminate the line. Leaving S3/S4/S5 at
their Hayes defaults (13/10/8) avoids this.

### Hayes Compliance Summary

The emulator implements the Hayes Smartmodem AT command set: AT, ATZ, AT&F,
AT&W, AT&V, ATE, ATV, ATQ, ATI (I0–I7), ATH, ATA, ATO, ATX, AT&C, AT&D,
AT&K, AT&Z (stored numbers), ATD (with T/P/L/S variants), ATSn, S-registers
S0–S26, the `A/` repeat-last-command shortcut, and the `+++` escape with
S2/S12 guard-time semantics. `AT&W` persists every Hayes setting — echo,
verbose, quiet, X, &C, &D, &K, the `+PETSCII` toggle, all 27 S-registers, and
four stored-number slots — to `egateway.conf`; `ATZ` restores them. Numeric and
verbose result codes honor the ATX level. (The `serial_X_drive_carrier` opt-in
is *not* part of this modem state — see the DCD note below.)

Commands the emulator can't meaningfully implement over TCP (`ATB`, `ATC`,
`ATL`, `ATM`, `AT&B`, `AT&G`, `AT&J`, `AT&S`, `AT&T`, `AT&Y`) are accepted
and return `OK` so that legacy init strings run to completion.

**Gateway-friendly default deviations:**

| Setting | Gateway default | Hayes default | Why we differ |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| `AT&D` | `&D0` (ignore DTR) | `&D2` (hang up on DTR drop) | Many retro clients don't drive DTR correctly. `&D2` would cause spurious disconnects. |
| `AT&K` | `&K0` (no modem-level flow control) | `&K3` (RTS/CTS) | C64, CP/M, and similar clients rarely implement hardware flow control. The physical port flow control is still set per-port by `serial_a_flowcontrol` / `serial_b_flowcontrol` in `egateway.conf`. |
| `S7` | 15 seconds | 50 seconds | Keeps failed TCP dials responsive. Raising S7 is allowed up to an internal cap of 60 s. |

All three deviations can be overridden interactively (e.g. `AT&D2`,
`AT&K3`, `ATS7=50`) and persisted with `AT&W`.

**Implementation notes:**

- `AT&D`, `AT&K`, and `AT&C` are parsed, stored, displayed in `AT&V`, and
  persisted. Their effects on RS-232 hardware signalling (DTR monitoring,
  RTS/CTS handshake) are not enforced by the emulator — **except** the `AT&C`
  DCD line, which *is* driven (as a DTR→DCD proxy) when the per-port
  `serial_X_drive_carrier` opt-in is enabled. See the **Limitations** section
  below for the wiring and the rationale.
- **`serial_X_drive_carrier` is a config-file setting, not modem state.**
  Because it reflects physical cabling, it is *not* reset by `ATZ`/`AT&F`, *not*
  saved by `AT&W`, and *not* shown in `AT&V` (unlike `AT&C`/`AT&D`/`AT&K`).
  Change it in the GUI/web config or the telnet per-port modem menu (**C** key);
  the `AT&C` mode it follows is the normal, ATZ-resettable modem setting.
- `ATX1`–`ATX4` all affect result codes and `CONNECT` formatting.
- `ATS6` (wait-for-dial-tone) and `ATS8` (comma pause) sleep for the
  configured number of seconds before the TCP connect, summed per modifier
  and capped at 60 seconds total.
- The `+++` escape follows the Hayes timing spec (one guard time of silence
  before the `+` triple, then another guard time after). Setting `ATS12=0`
  or `ATS2>127` disables escape detection.

### Escaping and Resuming

The `+++` escape sequence returns to command mode while keeping the connection
alive. Type `ATO` to resume the connection, or `ATH` to hang up. This follows
standard Hayes modem behavior: one second of silence, then `+++`, then another
second of silence.

### Ring Emulator

Telnet and SSH users can simulate an incoming phone call to a serial device
from the per-port settings menu (**I** — Ring emulator).  The Ring item is
per-port: pick **Configuration > M > A** (or **B**) first to choose
which port should ring, then press **I**.  The modem sends `RING`
to that port at standard US phone cadence (every 6 seconds).  After
S0 rings (default 5), the modem auto-answers and the serial device
receives the Ethernet Gateway main menu, just as if it had dialed in
with `ATDT ethernet-gateway`.  The serial device can also answer
manually with `ATA` during ringing.  The two ports' ring slots are
independent — Port A and Port B can be ringing simultaneously.

### Peer-Dial (Calling Another Port)

Peer-dial lets a modem port **call another serial port directly** and talk to
the device on it — the gateway equivalent of dialing a friend's modem to swap
files. Where `ATDT ethernet-gateway` reaches the *menu*, peer-dial connects
straight through to a specific port. It is **off by default**; enable
`allow_peer_dial` from **Configuration > M > P**, the web *Serial* config, or
the GUI.

Dial a port by its address, `<Port>@<IP>` — exactly what the **Serial Gateway**
menu shows (`Dial: <Port>@<ip>`), so you dial what you see:

```
ATD B@192.168.1.50      # call Port B on the gateway at 192.168.1.50
```

Picking a port in the Serial Gateway menu has the same effect as dialing its
address. What happens depends on the **target port's mode**:

- **Modem-mode target — it rings.** The device answers per its *own* AT rules:
  automatically after `S0` rings (`S0 = 0` disables auto-answer), or when its
  operator types `ATA`. A true dial-up call.
- **Console-mode (telnet-serial) target — it connects directly** (no modem to
  answer; leased-line style).

Once connected it is a **transparent byte pipe** between the two devices — run
XMODEM/YMODEM/ZMODEM/Kermit/Punter end to end between them, exactly as over a
real modem-to-modem call. Each port keeps its own baud rate (they need not
match); turn PETSCII translation off (`AT+PETSCII=0`) before a binary transfer.
The caller sees `CONNECT` on answer, `BUSY` if the target is already in a call,
`NO ANSWER` if it rings unanswered within the caller's `S7` (needs `ATX3`+), or
`NO CARRIER` otherwise.

> **Local echo:** the connection is a transparent link — neither gateway echoes
> the data, and (unlike dialing a host or BBS) there is no remote host echoing
> your keystrokes back. **Turn on local echo (half-duplex) on each terminal** to
> see what you type, exactly as with two terminals wired back-to-back. `ATE`
> does *not* help here — it only echoes `AT` commands in command mode, not the
> online data stream.

> **Ring count vs. answer timeout:** auto-answer waits `S0` rings at ~6 s each,
> so the default `S0 = 5` (~30 s) is longer than the caller's default `S7 = 15`
> wait — which would give `NO ANSWER` first (authentic modem behavior). On a
> port meant to be dialed, set a low `S0` (e.g. `ATS0=1`) or answer with `ATA`.

**Cross-gateway peer-dial (over the master/slave relay):** a device on a
**slave** can dial a port on its **master** — `ATD <Port>@<master-ip>`. The
slave relays the call to the master, which resolves the address to one of its
own ports and rings/connects it, bridging `device ↔ slave ↔ master ↔ port`.
This needs the slave's `allow_peer_dial` on (to relay) and the master's
`master_accept_relays` + `allow_peer_dial` on (to accept and bridge). Addressing
is by IP, so master and slave must have distinct addresses (normal for separate
machines). Cross-gateway is symmetric: `<Port>@<slave-ip>` reaches **any** port
a slave has — a **console** port connects directly, a **modem** port rings the
attached device — from the master or, with the master acting as a crossbar, from
another slave (device ↔ slave-A ↔ master ↔ slave-B ↔ device). A slave modem port
becomes dialable by announcing itself to the master (automatic when
`gateway_role = slave` and `allow_peer_dial` are set).

### Serial Safety

When changing a port's parameters from a serial session, the server asks
for confirmation. If there is no response within 60 seconds (e.g., because
the terminal settings no longer match), the settings are automatically
reverted. This prevents lockout when accidentally misconfiguring the
serial port the operator is connected through.

### Dialup Mapping

The Dialup Mapping feature (per-port menu **D**, reachable from
**Configuration > M > A or B**) lets you map phone numbers to
`host:port` targets.  The mapping table is **shared** across both
ports — `dialup.conf` is one file consulted by both modems — so a
number you've added is dialable from either Port A's or Port B's
modem with `ATDT`, `ATDP`, or `ATD`.  The server looks up the number
and connects to the mapped host instead.

A built-in entry maps **1001000** to the local Ethernet Gateway menu (equivalent
to `ATDT ethernet-gateway`). This entry cannot be deleted.

Mappings are stored in `dialup.conf` (created automatically on first access
with a default starter entry). Phone numbers are matched by digits only --
formatting characters like dashes, spaces, and parentheses are ignored, so
`555-1234` and `5551234` are treated as the same number.

If a dialed number has no mapping, the modem returns `NO CARRIER`. You can
still dial hostnames and `host:port` targets directly -- mappings only apply
when the dial string looks like a phone number (digits and formatting only, no
letters or dots).

### Limitations

This is a software modem emulator, not a real modem. The Hayes command set
(including `AT&C`, `AT&D`, `AT&K`) is fully parsed, stored, persisted via
`AT&W`, and displayed in `AT&V`. Most of the RS-232 hardware signal pins those
commands nominally control are **not** driven (see below); the one exception is
DCD, which can be driven via an opt-in:

- **DCD (Data Carrier Detect, pin 1)** -- A real modem asserts DCD when a
  carrier is established. By default this emulator does not drive DCD, so the
  serial device has no hardware indication that a connection is active. You can
  enable a **carrier proxy** per port with **`serial_a_drive_carrier` /
  `serial_b_drive_carrier`** (default `false`; also a checkbox in the GUI/web
  config and the **C** key in the telnet per-port menu). A PC / USB-serial
  adapter is wired as DTE and cannot drive a DCD *output* pin, so the gateway
  drives **DTR** as the carrier proxy and you cross **DTR→DCD** in a null-modem
  cable into the vintage machine's DCD input (the same trick tcpser uses). The
  line follows `AT&C`: `AT&C0` forces it always asserted while the port is open,
  `AT&C1` (default) asserts it on `CONNECT` and drops it on `NO CARRIER` / `ATH`
  / hangup / relay-link-loss. **When the opt-in is off the gateway makes zero
  modem-control-line calls**, so a port without DCD wiring is byte-for-byte
  unaffected. Modem mode only (console mode has no `AT&C` carrier concept).
- **RI (Ring Indicator, pin 9)** -- A real modem asserts RI when an incoming
  call is ringing. The ring emulator sends `RING` result codes over the
  serial data line, but the RI pin is never driven.
- **DSR (Data Set Ready, pin 6)** -- A real modem asserts DSR when powered
  on and ready. This emulator does not control DSR.
- **DTR (Data Terminal Ready, pin 4)** -- A real modem monitors DTR from the
  terminal to detect hangup requests. `AT&D2`/`AT&D3` is accepted and
  persisted, but the emulator does not read DTR (semantics vary by
  USB-to-serial adapter and platform). Use `ATH` or `+++` to hang up.
- **CTS/RTS (Clear to Send / Request to Send, pins 8/7)** -- `AT&K3`/`AT&K4`
  is accepted and persisted. Actual hardware or software flow control on the
  wire is controlled per-port by `serial_a_flowcontrol` / `serial_b_flowcontrol`
  in `egateway.conf` (not by `AT&K`), so retro clients that can't do RTS/CTS
  keep working at the per-port default of `none`.

Most retro terminal software works fine without these signals, especially
when configured to ignore DCD (sometimes labeled "Force DTR" or "Ignore
Carrier" in the terminal program settings). If your software requires DCD to
be asserted before it will communicate, either enable the `serial_X_drive_carrier`
carrier proxy above (and wire DTR→DCD), or check the terminal program's
configuration for an option to disable carrier detection.

### Console Mode (Telnet-Serial Bridge)

When a port is set to **Telnet-Serial Mode**, its Hayes emulator is
disabled and the port becomes selectable in the **G  Serial Gateway**
A/B picker.  Each port toggles independently, so Port A can run the
Hayes modem while Port B serves as a console bridge (or vice versa,
or both as bridges).  This is useful for talking to a microcontroller
or embedded console connected to one of the wires — your telnet/SSH
session becomes a transparent pipe to that port in both directions.

**Switching modes (per port):**

- **GUI:** open the chosen port's **More...** popup from the Serial
  Port frame and set its **Mode** dropdown to **Telnet-Serial Mode**.
  Save reconfigures only the changed port; the other port keeps
  running.
- **Telnet/SSH:** **Configuration > M (Serial Configuration) >
  A or B > T (Toggle Modem/Console mode)**.  The per-port menu's
  banner flips between `MODEM EMULATOR` and `SERIAL CONSOLE`, and
  the Dialup Mapping / Ring Emulator items hide in console mode.
  **T** is hidden from a session that arrived over the modem itself
  (flipping its own port to console would tear down its connection
  before it could acknowledge).
- **`egateway.conf`:** set `serial_a_mode = console` (or
  `serial_b_mode = console`).  The change is hot-applied within one
  manager-poll interval — no restart required.

**Using the bridge:**

1. From the main menu, press **G** (Serial Gateway).  An A/B picker
   appears showing both ports' status; ineligible ports (disabled,
   modem mode, no device) are dimmed.
2. Press **A** or **B** to pick a port.  The gateway prints that
   port's active framing (port, baud, data/parity/stop, flow) and
   asks `Connect now? (Y/N):` — type **Y** to enter the bridge.
3. Bytes flow in both directions until you press **ESC twice in a row**
   (PETSCII `<-` twice on Commodore terminals). A single ESC is
   forwarded to the wire on the next keystroke, so editors that need
   ESC (vi, emacs) keep working.

The bridge is single-user **per port**: only one telnet/SSH session at
a time can hold each port, but Port A and Port B can each host their
own concurrent bridge.  A second request to the same port gets
**Another session is already using Port X** until the first session
disconnects.

The Serial Gateway option is hidden from sessions that came in over a
serial port (you can't bridge a port back into its own bridge), and
also hidden when neither port is in console mode (so the menu doesn't
dead-end at an empty picker).

## Web Browser

The built-in text-mode web browser renders HTML pages as plain text with
numbered link references. It works on all terminal types, including 40-column
PETSCII screens.

### Browsing a Page

1. From the main menu, press **B** (Simple Browser)
2. Enter a URL (e.g. `example.com`) or a search query (e.g. `rust programming`)
   - URLs without a scheme automatically get `https://` prepended
   - Text without dots is treated as a search query and sent to DuckDuckGo
3. The page is fetched, converted to plain text, and displayed with pagination

### Understanding Links

When a page is displayed, clickable links are marked with numbered tags like
**[1]**, **[2]**, **[3]** next to the linked text. To follow a link, press
**L** and enter the link number.

### Page Navigation Commands

| Key   | Action                              |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| N / P | Next page / Previous page           |
| T / E | Jump to Top / End of page           |
| L     | Follow a link by number             |
| G     | Go to a new URL or search query     |
| S     | Search for text within the page     |
| F     | Fill out and submit forms           |
| K     | Save current page as a bookmark     |
| B     | Go back to the previous page        |
| R     | Reload the current page             |
| H     | Show help                           |
| Q     | Close page (return to browser home) |
| ESC   | Exit browser to main menu           |

### Bookmarks

- Press **K** while viewing a page to save it as a bookmark
- Press **K** on the browser home screen to open your saved bookmarks
- Select a bookmark by number to navigate to it
- Press **D** in the bookmarks list, then enter a number to delete one
- Up to 100 bookmarks are stored in `bookmarks.txt` next to the binary

### Forms

Many web pages contain forms (search boxes, login fields, etc.). When forms are
detected, the status line shows the form count. Press **F** to interact:

1. If multiple forms exist, select one by number
2. Edit fields by entering the field number
   - Text fields: type a new value
   - Select dropdowns: choose an option by number
   - Checkboxes and radio buttons: toggle or select
3. Press **S** to submit the form, or **Q** to cancel

### Browser Limits

- Maximum page size: 1 MB
- Maximum rendered lines: 5,000
- HTTP request timeout: 15 seconds
- Page history depth: 50 pages
- HTTPS **page loads** (GET) that fail due to TLS errors automatically retry
  over HTTP with a warning banner; **form submissions (POST) are refused, not
  downgraded**, so form data is never re-sent in the clear

### Gopher Protocol

The browser supports the Gopher protocol alongside HTTP/HTTPS. Gopher is a
text-native protocol that predates the web and renders beautifully on retro
terminals, including 40-column PETSCII screens.

To browse a Gopher server, press **G** and enter a `gopher://` URL:

```
gopher://gopher.floodgap.com
gopher://gopher.quux.org
```

Gopher directory listings are displayed with numbered links, just like web
pages. Text files are displayed as plain text. Gopher search items (type 7)
automatically prompt for a search query before fetching results. All browser
features (pagination, history, back, bookmarks) work with Gopher URLs.

## AI Chat

AI Chat provides an interactive question-and-answer interface powered by the
Groq API. Requires a Groq API key (see [Setting Up AI Chat](#setting-up-ai-chat)
above).

1. From the main menu, press **A** (AI Chat)
2. Type a question and press Enter
3. The server shows "Thinking..." while waiting for the response
4. The answer is displayed with pagination (**N** next, **P** previous, **Q** done)
5. From the answer screen, type a new question to continue the conversation,
   or press **Q** to return to the main menu

Responses are word-wrapped to fit the terminal width (38 columns for PETSCII,
78 for ANSI/ASCII).

## Weather

The Weather feature displays current conditions and a 3-day forecast for any
city or postal code **worldwide**, powered by [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com)
(free, no API key required), with [MET Norway](https://api.met.no) as an
automatic fallback forecast provider.

1. From the main menu, press **W** (Weather)
2. Enter a city or postal code, or press Enter to use the last one. Examples:
   `62051`, `London`, `London, GB` (or `London, Ontario`), `Zürich`,
   `Tokyo, JP`. A `City, Country` (or `City, Region`) qualifier disambiguates
   common names; the matched country is shown so you can confirm.
3. Current temperature, humidity, wind, and a 3-day forecast are displayed.
   Press **U** on the weather screen to cycle display units.

Units follow the `weather_units` setting: `auto` (the default — Fahrenheit/mph
for the US, Celsius/km/h everywhere else), `us`, or `metric`.

The last-used location is saved to `egateway.conf` (key `weather_location`) so
it becomes the default for all future sessions. An older config's `weather_zip`
value is migrated automatically on first load.

## Signals

The server handles POSIX signals for graceful shutdown:

- **SIGINT** (Ctrl+C) -- Shut down, notify all connected sessions
- **SIGTERM** -- Shut down (e.g., from `kill` or systemd)
- **SIGHUP** -- Shut down
